The Chameleon framework is a framework for creating software languages.

Design priciples
================

* Modularity is extremely important.
  - Language semantics are modularized as much as possible.
  - Tools contain no language semantics, language models contain no tool related functionality. This makes it very easy to create language-independent tools.
  - By doing this, the framework can do a lot of work for you without imposing limitations. You can plug in your own semantics when required.
  - Another advantage is that you can easily reuse language constructs from other languages, as they generally don't depend on other details.
  - Many default implementations are provided to limit the amount of code you must write.
  - Examples
    - Tools do not check the correctness of models. Models check themselves for correctness.
    - Every language automatically has support for namespaces and imports.
    - The dependency analysis works out of the box for any language. The same can be done
      other operations, such as generic refactorings.
    - The separate Eclipse IDE only needs a few lines of code to support a new language.
    - Type parameters in the Java language model do not affect elements
      that do not directly involve type parameters. Variables work correctly for parameterized
      types without even knowing that type parameters exist.
    - Metadata can be added to element, should a tool wish to do so. The separate Eclipse uses this to track the positions of models elements.

* Models are allowed to be incomplete. See the CrossReference interface for information on how this is achieved.
* No code generation, everything is programming in Java. Programming with generated code is too messy. You can use a parser generator for parsing files, but the framework does not require it.

Most important abstractions
===========================

Read the documentation of the following types.

- Element: every language construct is an element.
- CrossReference: everything that points to another element
  - NameReference is a default implementation that should work for almost any language. Try to use it instead of creating new implementations.
- Declaration: something that can be referenced. Basically everything with a 'name'.
- Signature: a 'name' of a declaration.
- Namespace: the namespace of a declaration. Think of the package structure of Java, or the namespace structur of C#
- Document: containers of model descriptions. This is usually a file.
- DocumentLoader: an object that loads a single document
- DocumentScanner: an object that scans a resource (a .jar file, a directory, a database,...) and creates document loaders for the documents that were found.
- View: a part of a project that uses a particular language.
- Project: a collection of views. For now, multiple are not supported well enough. Cross-language lookup support is not yet provided out of the box.
