/**
 * A class for comparing declarations according to form certain relation. Examples
 * include overrides and hides relations. Note that a DeclarationComparator does not have the
 * responsibility to encode the entire relation. A DeclarationComparator only checks if a
 * pair of potential candidates is in the relation. It does not determine the set of candidates.
 * The latter is the responsibility of the involved DeclarationContainers (such as types) and the relations between
 * them (such as inheritance relations).
 * 
 * Typically a declaration class will have a private static member field to store the object, and
 * a public (non-static) getter to obtain it. This still allows dynamic binding while avoiding the
 * creation of too many comparator objects. This is not the ideal OO solution, but in this case
 * the disadvantage is not too big, whereas the gain is speed is.
