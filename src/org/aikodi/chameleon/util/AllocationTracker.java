/**
 * A helper class for tracking the memory allocation behavior of objects.
 * 
 * For example, if you suspect that an object allocates too many temporary
 * collections, you can let it {@link #increase(Object)} its counter. After
 * running your code, you can then ask an overview per creator or per class
 * of creators to find out where most of the unnecessary allocations are done.
 * Caching everything requires too much error-prone code. This class can help you
 * to track the hot spots.
 * 
 * This class is typically used in code that is thrown away afterwards. You don't want
 * profiling code slowing everything down after you're done profiling. Therefore I
 * usually create a public final static field somewhere and add code to increase the
 * counters. After the run, the field is used for the output. When the most important
 * hot spots are removed, all the profiling code is removed.
