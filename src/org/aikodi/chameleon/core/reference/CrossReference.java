/**
 * <p>This interface represents the concept of a cross-reference in the model. A
 * construct is a cross-reference if it points to another element in the model
 * instead of containing it as a descendant or having it as an ancestor. For
 * example, when a variable is access in source code, the variable is referenced
 * by writing the name of that variable. It is the job of the lookup mechanism
 * to find out which variable that is.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Cross-references are <b>never</b> modeled with direct object references.
 * Instead a cross-reference offers the {@link #getElement()} method to obtain
 * the referenced object. Internally, a cross-reference may store direct
 * references in its cache, but these are cleared when the model is modified.
 * The reason for this choice is twofold. First, when a part of the model is
 * modified, it is very hard to find out which cross-references points to a
 * different element (possibly none) after the change. In most cases, every
 * cross-reference in the entire model could be affected. But most importantly,
 * this way of modeling corresponds directly to the semantics of the code. The
 * variable name "a" in the source code is not tied to a particular variable
 * with name "a". Instead, its semantics is that it refers to whatever variable
 * with name "a" that it in scope in the current state of the model. If we
 * remove the variable that it currently refers to, it will simply refer to
 * another variable with name "a" in scope (if such a variable exists).</p>
 * 
 * <p>All logical structures are implemented in terms of cross-references. For
 * example, a subclass relation will contain a cross-reference that points to
 * the superclass.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that the result of {@link #getElement()} is not necessarily a part of
 * the lexical model. For example a C# property also defines methods. These
 * references will be found by the lookup mechanism, but they are not part of
 * the base C# model. In case of such generated elements, the
 * {@link #getDeclarator()} method will return the element that generated the
 * referenced element.</p>
