	 * <code>a</code>. Therefore, two contexts are provided: a lexical context and 
	 * a target context.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>For example:</p>
	 * <ol>
	 *   <li>in "expr.f", "f" must be looked up in the static type of "expr",
	 *  and not in its lexical context, which is the current lexical context.</li>
	 *   <li>in "typename.f", "f" must be looked up in the type represented by "typename"</li>
	 *   <li>in "packagename.f", "f" must be looked up in the package represented by "package"</li>
